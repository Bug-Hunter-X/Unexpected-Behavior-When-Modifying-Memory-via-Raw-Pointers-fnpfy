This repository showcases a common error in Rust programming related to using raw pointers. The `bug.rs` file demonstrates code that modifies the memory pointed to by a raw pointer. This leads to undefined behavior, because the pointer's validity is not guaranteed. The `bugSolution.rs` shows how to avoid this problem by using safer Rust features, avoiding raw pointers whenever possible.
